The only other major side effect has been frequent bleeding and much heavier periods than usual.  I normally have a fairly light, short period (2 days normal bleeding, 1-2 of spotting). But there have been two occasions since starting Lyza in which I have woken up in a pool of blood on the bed because the bleeding is so heavy and unexpected. There has been some bloating as well, but I'm not sure if that is due to the pill because I had the same issue with Mirena. I have my suspicions about ovarian cysts, so that could be causing the bloating, breast tenderness, and abnormal bleeding. I rated ease of use as one star because it has been very difficult for me to remember to take the pill on time even though I set an alarm on my phone. However, it is still effective because I haven't gotten pregnant yet. I just make sure to use back up protection, or abstain for 3 days after taking a pill late.

The reason why i desperately needed this pill was because i was flying out to las vegas to see my boyfriend for a week and it just so happen to be that i was supposed to get my period at that time. I'm not on birth control (but i should be) because i dont want my mother to think that im having sex etc. So i went to las vegas and for the first four days i was there i didnt get my period (thank god) and the fifth day i got it and took the pills that morning afternoon and night for the first few days of my period hoping that it would have some effect. Well, it didn't. I was so pissed off because i get terrible periods where i can't get out of bed and i'm really not a nice person and highly emotional and it's just not a good time for me. Plus i was staying with my boyfriend and thats so not fun if i have it.

We are talking the first 3 days so heavy that leaving the house was a challenge. I would go through 2 packages of overnight pads plus superplus tampons every period. Ruining clothing, sleeping with a towel in the bed, cramping severly with large blood clots. Birthcontrol pills had the reverse effect on me causing me to bleed 3 weeks on and 1 week off. So no good. Finally, years later a doctor finally recognized the help I needed and suggested Lysteda and I love it. Now I only use 1 package of pads with some left over. My life is on again. I can enjoy outings with my husband and children without panic of changing a pad and tampon within 30 minutes.

What was unusual was I felt a contraction type feeling the 3rd morning after I took the Lysteda that lasted about a 1/2 hour. The contraction feeling was not painful, just freaky. No other unusual side effects noted at this time. The number of days on cycle were as usual. My flow was reduced by 50% or more. I was not tied to a bathroom like I usually am on days 2-5! I messed up on the dosage the first day and only took one 650mg tablet in the morning and afternoon. Taking only one had reduced it some (like 20%) but not as much as it did once I got my actual prescription and noticed I needed to take two 650mg tablets, three times a day. My doctor prescribed it correctly, I had forgotten how many she said. It seemed like it would be a lot to remember taking the meds at first, but if someone has a vested interest such as I, you don't forget...believe me! I did start the meds on day 2 and stopped at bedtime on day 5, my doctor says however I should start taking them on day 1. I am not a big fan of taking medication for anything, but I recommend Lysteda because it was very freeing. I will try to remember to post updates after continued usage, especially if I develop side-effects. I've found the reviews of others very helpful to me.  

Note for medical professionals: A strange occurance that may be linked to the contraction type feeling on morning 3. I had two ultra sounds. One about a week after my last period ended and one two days after this past period ended (lysteda usage) and the technician told me my uterus was significantly smaller in size.

Bleeding has been reduced by at least 80%, no side effects at all. I feel like I've regained 5 days of my life each month.

On some days I would go thru a super plus tampon every 20 minutes & could not sleep the night because of all the leaking. Now, w/Lysteda my flow is back to normal & I can actually stand upright & get back to physical activity.  I just completed a half-marathon & I had my period on race day but after taking Lysteda.

I do occasionally pass a large clot, but then it immediately stops.  I was veer anemic when I started and now my iron levels after 4 months are in the normal range for the first time in 10 years.

I am 35, have 2 kids, and have tried some of the hormonal BC pills, rings, etc… but they have all had adverse effects on me, so I wont use them anymore.  Normally my periods are 7 full days of bleeding.  Days 2-4 I usually wore heavy/overnight pads & super size tampon that I had to change almost every hour around the clock, or I would risk bleeding through everything in sight.  My period this month was due when I was on vacation (of course!), so it showed up the moment we got to our destination.  Using Lysteda, I was able to enjoy myself- swimming, sports activities, sleeping comfortably- w/o being paranoid about where the nearest bathroom was and w/o wondering if I was going to feel a mortifying gush of blood at any moments notice.  It does not stop bleeding all together, but I would say I had a 50% or more decrease.  I used probably 1/4 the number of tampons & pads I usually would.  Taking the pills was not a problem, and after day 5, when you stop taking them, my period just abruptly ended.  I had no noticeable side effects.  I am interested to see if my period will get even more tolerable as I continue taking the pills.  Worth a try in my opinion if your period incapacitates you every month like mine did!

19-24,Neuropathic Pain,12/8/2019,lyrica,93965,1,3,"After being on Lyrica (pregabalin) for over two years, I've experienced the positive effects that many report, but also the terrible side effects and dependency.  Lyrica decreased my sensitivity and pain, but only in the beginning.  In my experience, it is a drug that your body builds a tolerance to after some time (for me approx 2-3 weeks in which you get the positive effects), however after this period positive effects wear off as your body has built a tolerance, prompting the GP/Pain specialist to increase the dosage beginning a cycle of increasing dosages and built tolerance.  
I got up to 250mg without doctors giving me any warnings of the increased risk of side effects.  Besides weight gain, there is a risk of memory and concentration loss, very real and debilitating effects that were not advertised to me.  Upon realising that these side effects were greatly impacting my life (would forget where I was and what day it was), my GP advised me to decrease the dosage slowly.  Lyrica had made my body so dependent on the drug that decreasing caused major withdrawal effects, as if I was coming off some kind of illicit drug (cold sweats, trembling, migraine, nausea and increased pain to the extent that moving was rarely possible).  I am still on Lyrica and have gone through another withdrawal episode, however am now on 150mg.  I strongly suggest that anyone going on the drug carefully consider the effects.  If your doctor has no concerns that over a year your pain is still increasing despite increasing the dosage and they have no other plans of treatment, get a new doctor!  Don't get to the stage where you can't maintain a reasonable dose and become stuck and dependent on the drug while experiencing potentially detrimental side effects.  There are many other drugs and therapies out there for pain which may better help your condition.",1,Female,"Drowsiness,  dizziness ,  dry mouth ,  constipation , difficulty concentrating, or  weight  gain may occur.",14

The pain so bad unable to do anything but go to the toilet. So was prescribed OxyContin to help with pain. I am a person that quit taking every medication that doctors had prescribed me because I didn't want the poison in my body any more. I weaned myself off the ones that caused side effects when quitting but I did it. The only time I Took anything for pain is when it got so bad I couldn't function. This was all before this recent damage to my lower back. I have had to quit work, I can no longer go for long walks let alone run, as I was a runner and always moving doing some sort of activity. Before taking the Lyrica I was wasting away in a lounge chair at my daughters unable to live on my own. Back to the drug...still in heaps of pain s o back to see doc in tears. She upped my dose to 150 twice aday. That helped a lot but still u able to do anything. So back to doc and gave me Naproxen 1000 once aday. That helped tremendously. I can now walk and do things although nothing strenuous. Any lifting I could feel the pinching of the nerve. Still unable to do much of anything. Think my injury is too bad to have a really good reaction to the Lyrica. I have been on it for about 2 months.

They have to keep giving me a higher dosage due to the fact that the effects wear off over time. I am now starting the max dosage they can give me. I will be on 200 mg three times a day, so hopefully this will not wear off like the other dosages.

55-64,Nerve Pain after Herpes,8/12/2010,lyrica,93965,3,4,"I have PHN, nerve damage from shingles. I am now 58, had it when I was 56. Docs first put me on gabapentin (neurontin) which only reduced my pain for about an hour a day.  I finally went back and they said oh, let's try you on Lyrica (insurances require you trying neurontin first).  Bingo! Pain Relief!!   It gives about 75% of pain relief - slightly more on a good day; less on a bad day.   Of course since the affected nerve trunk for me was the main torso, right along the bra line, if I wear a bra forget it, nothing helps - YEOWW,  OUCH.   

The main problem with Lyrica is that it turned my brain to mush.  No short-term memory, transposing letters and numbers (and I was an editor, never transposed a thing in my life), forgetfulness.  I can no longer have meaningful employment as I can't remember directions or instructions from one minute to the next. You should see me make coffee in the morning! Who knew there were so many steps to forget? (filter, coffee, water, oh and don't forget to put the pot in the coffeemaker! I have forgotten all steps at some point).  

I often forget to take my med unless reminded by my spouse and if I forget, the pain comes back with a vengance and that sure reminds me!  I would rather not be on Lyrica, and periodically get tired of being such an airhead and try to reduce it, but the PAIN is unliveable and reminds me of my choices.

I wish I'd never had shingles and had my nerve trunk damaged.  Everybody out there, GET THE VACCINE!!  But since I did and I can't change that, I am so so so grateful for Lyrica.  ANd I can't wait for the 7 years to be up so I can get the generic.  With insurance it's $50/month, without is about $250 I think.
