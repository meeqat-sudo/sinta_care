I would wake and remain useless and tire for an addition two hours. My behavior is far more irritable than ever before, and I find myself full of anger and wanting to pound my fists through the wall, or destroy sometime just because it was within arms reach. I find the taste of this medication absolutely repulsive. My appetite has spiraled out of control and I have gained 17 pounds in the last two months. My Diabetes is hyperglycemic with blood sugars above 200, thus requiring higher than normal insulin injections with greater CC's of insulin per injection. Finally, the copayment is prohibitive, even after insurance pays their pittance-share.

I do not reccommend this medication whatsoever. I will never try it for a third time.

25-34,Additional Medications to Treat Depression,8/7/2010,"saphris tablet, sublingual",152902,3,5,"Yes, it tastes lousy.  Won’t lie there.   But having tried literally every other drug similar to this in the past 12 years, I am getting the best results I have ever had with any of them.  And it is fairly weight-neutral - nothing a little extra time at the gym and some good food choices won't overcome.  NOTHING like the 40 pounds I put on in 8 weeks with Zyprexa.  Currently, I take 10 mg of Saphris each night with 60 mg of Prozac each morning...and my depression is better than is has been in years (without being manic).

My advice: just put up with the taste for 10 minutes.  It’s not that bad if you do it carefully…and I’d much rather have a bitter taste in my mouth followed by a little temporary numbness than the crazy weight gain I was getting from other atypical antipsychotics I was being prescribed for my treatment resistant depression (which has been argued to be Bipolar II Disorder...but really, what does the specific diagnosis matter?  I was super depressed for a long time...and now I'm not).

Now here’s the catch: my insurance is NOT covering this drug yet.  Luckily my psychiatrist has been giving me samples for like 6 months now.  Hope we can keep this arrangement up until this gets added to my insurance formulary (or we can successfully appeal the insurance company to cover it).  I really don’t want to go back to the way things were before I found this drug.

Every drug works differently for every person.  But if you have tried all the other options, don’t be scared to try this one.  A bitter taste in your mouth is a small price to pay for what might be the right med choice for you.

Oh, and when I started taking the Saphris, I started seeing positive results within my first week of taking it.  I wasn't “cured” overnight or anything like that, but things started getting noticeably easier within the first few days of having this med.

I have tried every possible anti-depressant marketed with the exception of a few. I had no choice but to retire from a 20 year career. After about a year with my new physc, trying basically all the new anti-depressants on the market, it would relieve some of the symptoms for a short period of time then nothing!! At last we thought we had found the right combination of meds to deal with my illness. I started taking Celexa, Lamactil, xanax and trazadone. That lasted for about 2 years then my symptoms came back with a vengance!! My doctor gave me samples of Saphris SL, discontinued the Celexa and cut my trazadone in half, they told me about the terrible taste so I was expecting that. I have been on the Saphris SL for about 4 weeks at bedtime and stopped the trazadone because the combination was so sedating. I would sleep for 2-3 hrs and wake up sometimes needing to go the the restroom and I couldn't even function, I could hardly hold my eyes open and my coordination was limited at best, much to my regret, I have turned into a monster! I have never been a violent person even with my illness. My family noticed the change in me after about 2 weeks of taking the medication and I am gaining weight rapidly and serious swelling all over. I did start to notice that pretty much anything anyone said to me made me angry. I blew it off as stress, but never have I experienced such aggitation before. I continued to take the medication for 2 more weeks trying to give it a fair shot. Last night to my horror I started throwing everything I could find at the wall!!!! I grabbed my car keys and off I went. Thankfully I arrived home safe., I knew it had to be the medication. Last night I quit taking it and will NEVER take it again.  I DO NOT recommend this.

I have noticed no difference in my non-sleep pattern; I was hoping for at least 4-5 hours of sleep but remain at my 2-3 hours.

19-24,Birth Control,4/10/2013,amethia,156569,5,5,"This is the first time I take any form of birth control, so from the start I did my research of the many types and brands. At the end of the day I chose Seasonique-lo, but because of a miss-communication with my Dr I got Amethia (or rather the generic for the regular Seasonique) Right away I looked up reviews and I was honestly freaked out by the many negative reviews here. I decided to go ahead and try it out anyway since BC works differently in each body.

I am so happy to say that it's worked out great :) I started my pack on the day of my period by Dr orders (and biologically speaking it is the best time to start since your cycle is just resetting) So that I think helped with my body adjusting quicker.

Pros: I don't have mood swings. If anything I feel ""calmer"" now without the monthly fluctuating of hormones. Higher libido.

Cons: My first period lasted about 2 weeks and then 2 weeks later, I got my period again for like 3 weeks. It was light but annoying for me and my man. Just ride it out. It gets better. It's just your body adjusting.

Tips: Take it at the SAME time each day. Set up your alarm on your phone. I have two alarms. A warning like 3 min before and at the exact time. Trust me. It helps. Also, I started a healthy lifestyle regimen around the same time I started taking this (coincidence). I eat clean, stay away from junk/processed foods, drink over 4 liters of water everyday, weight train and cardio 4+ days a week, and take fish oil and multivitamins/minerals. Lifestyle and nutrition plays a HUGE factor on how your body reacts to medicines, so definitely keep that in mind.

Just give it a shot. Don't give up after the first crummy weeks. Your body usually takes about 6mo to a year to get used to any birth control.

Having said that, Amethia stopped my period and has allowed me to have 3 period free months.  I'm very happy that it has stopped but there are some side effects that started in the second month.  I have noticed that my hair was thinning out a lot, my face broke out really bad and my mood swings were unpleasant...for everybody.  When I relaized it was the birth control I mellowed out and am now able to control my moods better.  There was also brown discharge...not so sure if it's left over blood or not.  I would bleed a little after I tried to have sex.  i kinda stopped having sex after that so that there wouldn't be anymore breakout bleeding. By the middle of the 3rd month the side effects started to subside.  Also, the spotting ( with no sex) was once a day for the first month until I decided to workout.  The spotting stopped after 7 days of yoga and ab exercises.  To make sure that it was the workout that was helping I stopped working out and after 3-4 days the spotting continued.  Started working out again and after a few days it stopped again.  But now since I'm only 1 week away from having my period the spotting has come back and it's kinda heavy, 2 times a day, and I have cramps but I'm ok.  I have yet to see how this period is going to be.  Hopefully it's not out of control and goes away once I start the new pack. I will make an update to let you all know what happens.  I hope this review helps someone and wish everyone the best.",4,Female,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  headache ,  bloating ,  breast  tenderness, swelling of the  ankles /feet (fluid retention), or  weight  change may occur.",0

Before birth control pills, my period would last 6 months then stop for 2 days, then start again for another 4-6 months. It was extremely heavy. I would use at least 8 ultra heavy overnight pads a day. I went to the doctor & asked for Seasonale. At the time it was new & only had brand name. I took it & 2 days later I had no period. I took it for years before having to switch to generic Seasonale, called Jolessa. Jolessa is just as good too, with a little spotting. Also I've never taken the inactive pills. I have not had a period in 7 years. Then one day I needed a refill but my pharmacy didn't have any Seasonale or Jolessa, so they called my doctor, & she gave me a free sample pack of brand name Seasonique, which is exactly the same as Seasonale, except for the last 7 pills, which I have never taken on any of the 3 birth control pills. I love brand name Seasonique. Then I recently went to my doctor for a new prescription and asked for Seasonique & was given a script. When I got to the pharmacy, they only had generic Seasonique, called Amethia, so I had no choice but to get it. Amethia is made by a different company than Jolessa. I had no problems with either brand name, or generic Seasonale. But generic Seasonique (Amethia) is HORRIBLE. My face constantly feels like it is on fire, my stomach always hurts, and I am throwing up. Remember I am a virgin so this is not morning sickness or anything. I won't be able to get a refill for over a month, so for now I have to suffer with these side effects of generic Seasonique. But when I can get a refill, I will pay the extra $100 to get Seasonique, or have them call my doctor for a Seasonale prescription and get the generic Jolessa.",1,Female,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  headache ,  bloating ,  breast  tenderness, swelling of the  ankles /feet (fluid retention), or  weight  change may occur.",0

Sometimes I will go two or three times in the morning, it depends on what kind of condition my stomach is in that day. I don't have any of the severe side effects that I read about, or that I experienced the first try. I think some of what I experienced the first go around was because of what I had read and I was just a little afraid of the medication. The one thing that I have noticed is that I do have a little more fatigue than normal and also at times I wonder if I am a little depressed. I'm not certain about the depression because I'm also a recovering alcholic and drug addict. My IBS symptons did not become an issue until I got off the substances. Funny how our bodies work. I've read a lot about this drug and IBS and it seems to work for some and not for others. My bowel movements began pretty much immediately, and it has continued that way.

This medication comes with a lot of really dramatic side affects. It is constantly flushing potassium, calcium, and magnesium from the body. For me this meant muscle aches and pains that grew so extreme that I could not often walk or take the medication anymore. I also experienced one of the more rare side effects which is extreme joint pain. This became unbearable! I( learned from the PubChem.com website that the medication impedes production of a particular acid that helps with the natural anti-inflammatory process in the body.)
 So, while this medication did help my body retain sodium and made me feel more stable the side effects of pain, inflammation, cramping, grumpy mood changes, and weight gain or so extreme that there’s no way I could stay on this medication!

65-74,Addison's Disease,1/11/2009,fludrocortisone acetate,6802,5,5,Hopefully someone reading this will benefit. All of my adult life my blood pressure has been 110/68-70 without any ill effects until the late '90's when I began becoming very dizzy and lightheaded whenever I stood up especially if I raised up suddently. Eventuially I began to have attacks of syncope (fainting)or near syncope until I began receiving injuries from the falls and numerous hospital stays and miss diagnosis even though I had failed the tilt table test until a heady nurse witnessed my having an attack which lead to their checking my Cortisol levels. Adrenal gland production which affects our hormones. I was prescribed fludrocortisne.1mg three times daily along with hydrocortisone 10mg's 3 x daily. It has saved my life. Insofar as syncope attacks it is my understanding that once the falling blood pressure has been controlled and continuing syncope attacks presists then it most likely is another problem that needs addressing. I too remain suffering from syncope. Luckily a relative learned from a friend about narcolepsy (a sleep disorder) which my Dr believes may be the underlying cause of my syncopy attacks. If you are a snorer always exhausted with syncopy check it out. My Dr prescribed a new medication on a 30 day trial called provigil 100mg once daily in A. M. so far so good. Anyone that's suffering from the symtoms on this blob need to be presistant in having their Dr check as many avenues as possible and see a good neurologist.

This flare up was especially bad leaving me unable to even care for myself at the most basic levels.
Doc phoned in this med. Started my 3x daily at noon yesterday and took on ein the evening before bed.
I am SO pleased that I woke up this morning with marked improvement in ability to walk, and stand. I actually could take a shower and I just got back from Wawa to get FRESH milk for my morning coffee when i have not been ablt to drive there, navigate the store and line and register and drive home safely in WEEKS!
I know this isnt a miracle pill and Im far from back to my old baseline of ability but just the fact I regained my ability for the simplest tasks really made me grateful that these little tic-tacs are helping me.

Only drug that has effectively controlled the deep and aching bone pain from these conditions. 

Sometimes, difficult to obtain and stigma associated with ""drug addicts"" eg. heroin withdrawal, etc. continues to present problematic behavior even with some pharmacists.  I had one even call me a ""heroin junky"" and a ""pharmacy shopper"" when I took my prescription to be filled.  

The pharmacy I normally use did not have any methadone in stock. I had explained this to the pharmacy technician who neglected to convey this information to the pharmacist.

The pharmacist was unfortunately biased, misinformed, and unethical.  I guess Walmart doesn't always have the best staff!

Unfortunately, this medication can only be written for a 30 day, one-time  prescription with no refills due to federal regulations, so you must get a new prescription every 30 days from your doctor and pharmacy. Also, many pharmacies do not stock it or stock very little.  The presription must be filled exactly as written so it is sometimes time-consuming and inconvenient to obtain and you might have to ""Pharmacy shop"".

Withdrawal off this medicine is worse than coming off of heroin and much more dangerous, so do not attempt withdrawal unless under medical care.

I know from trying to take myself off of it, what a nightmare!  My doctor explained the difficult dynamics of withdrawal compared to other pain medications and even heroin.  After two weeks of cold turkey I already knew.

Do not start to take this medicine unless other pain medications are ineffective.\ I recommend this only because of the severity of trying to withdraw from it.

Dropped weight and pain and anxiety fairly fast... probably as I wasn't on it as long as first time. So a month after being off the Altace, protein spikes again. So thought I'd try low dose. 1.25. No effect on the protein leak but stopped losing weight immediately and neck and shoulder stiffness. Doubled the dose to 2.5 a week ago and within a couple days severe neck and shoulder pain and water retention.. started gaining even though I jog everyday and am on a calorie restricted diet. Today I have made the decision I can't take this med. At 2.5mg the protein is reduced but I am miserable. I am also major allergic to Atacand.. Angiodema caused vocal chords to swell and it took 5 weeks to heal after coming off that drug. So I have no proteinuria drugs I can take.

I suffer from depression, recently it’s been much worse than normal despite my efforts (supplements etc) and I have had mood swings, weight gain, no libido. 
I assummed this all was relative to my depression and body issues in general as well as my diet. 
I honestly never looked hard at the time line and came to the conclusion of the side effects being terrible; reading all these other reviews I’m now going to quit taking it immediately. It’s actually a relief to realize that it’s a side effect of this, I just thought my depression and other issues were worsening. I’m relieved to find out otherwise so I can change me routine and go with a different form of birth control. (My libido has been so low recently as a side effect  I really didn’t even need it)  It regulates my period which is nice, but not worth the side effects, I should have quit taking this months ago.

I had excellent mental health but this drug would increase my heart rate constantly making me feel on edge like I need to jump. Mood swings for the first time in my life were prominent.
